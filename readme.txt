Goods Catalog provides a catalog of products organized into categories. It is easy to use and fully customizable.

== Description ==

Goods Catalog was created to help you organize a simple catalog of products on WordPress site.

= Main features =

* Unlimited categories of products with unlimited depth of subcategories
* Tumbnails for categories and products
* The separate sidebar for the catalog, to show different widgets on the catalog and other pages.
* Shortcodes
* Widgets

The catalog created with Goods Catalog is easy to navigate: at the main catalog page are located all parent categories of products, at the category page firstly are located subcategories and then products of the category.

= Shortcodes =

* Use shortcode [goods_newest] to display the newest products anywhere in the site: on post or page. For example, to show 6 products, type: [goods_newest number=6]
* [goods_categories] to display the list of goods categories (many thanks to Alexander Chizhov & Pineapple Design Studio)
* [goods_tags] to display list of all products' tags
* [goods_sitemap] to display sitemap of the catalog (testing mode)

= Languages =

Goods Catalog is ready for localization to your language. Now it is available in the following languages:

* English
* Russian
* Spanish (thanks to netsis)
* French (thanks to Bertrand)
* Italian (thanks to Massimo Gallarotti)

You can send me translation for your language, and I'll add it to the release.

= Get involved =

You can contribute code and localizations to this plugin via [GitHub](https://github.com/ierhyna/goods-catalog)

== Installation ==

= Install the Goods Catalog Plugin =

The easiest way to install Goods Catalog plugin is the automatic installation:

* From WordPress admin panel, navigate to the `Plugins` menu and click `Add New`,
* In the search field type `"Goods Catalog"` and click `Search Plugins`. Found Goods Catalog plugin in the list.
* Click `Install Now`.

Or you can install the plugin manually:

* Download the plugin in `.zip` archive.
* Upload unzipped `goods-catalog` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

After the installation, please activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.

= Install the dependencies =

Please install [Taxonomy Images plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxonomy-images/), that provides thumbnails for categories.

= Basic configuration =

After you have the Goods Catalog installed, you need to flush the permalinks to prevent 404 errors. Just go to `Settings -> Permalinks` and press "Save". You don't need to change your permalinks.

2. Page of category with subcategories and products
3. Singe product page
4. Admin page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= There is 404 on /catalog or products page =
You need to update your permalinks. Just go to `Settings -> Permalinks` and press "Save". You don't need to change it.

= There are no thumbnails for the categories =
Please use [Taxonomy Images plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxonomy-images/) to attach image to category, and than turn on "Show Thumbnails for categories" option in Gooods Catalog plugin settings.

= Can I use sidebar in the catalog pages? =
Sure! There is special sidebar for the catalog. All widgets you put in there will be available only for catalog pages. Please, set up the sidebar in the plugin settings.

= How can I translate Goods Catalog to my language? =
Please use one of translation tools, [listed in the Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress#Translation_Tools) to open .POT file and create your own translation. You can put your .PO and .MO files into `/wp-content/languages/plugins/` and you will not loose the translations after plugin update.
Also, you can send me your language files and I'll add them to the release.

= How to customize title meta tag on catalog or category page? =
The simpliest way is to use some SEO plugins that allow to customize titles: ex., [WordPress SEO by Yoast](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) or [All in One SEO Pack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/).

Or you can manually change your theme's header.php (see [here](http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/130747/custom-post-type-archive-page-title)). 

Another option is to change the plugin files see the discussion [here](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-modify-the-catalog-title-page). It is not recommended: you will lose the changes after the plugin update.
